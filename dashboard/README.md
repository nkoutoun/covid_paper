# 🇧🇪 Belgium COVID-19 Interactive Dashboard

An interactive web dashboard for exploring COVID-19 data across Belgian municipalities with temporal analysis and geospatial visualization.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Municipality Map**: Choropleth visualization with real Belgian boundaries (581 municipalities)
- **Temporal Analysis**: Time slider covering 2019-2022 with adaptive time marks
- **Multiple Variables**: COVID-19 cases, stringency index, vaccination rates, population data
- **Real-time Statistics**: Dynamic statistics cards showing totals, means, and maximums
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for web deployment with fast performance

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Local Development
